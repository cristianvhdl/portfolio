Developer Team: IdleMind Workshop

This was a final group project for a software practice class at the University of Utah.  The bulk of my contribution included importing/setting up external libraries, implementing the physics engine, and overall game mechanics. 

# Concept #

This game is a spin on Angry Birds where, instead of you launching birds to destroy the pigs’ castle, you have to protect your own castle from an onslaught of words that are automatically launched from the right side of the screen. You have to destroy the words before they hit your castle by typing them in as fast as you can. As the levels progress, the words get longer and fly faster. This game is essentially a typing game that focuses on improving the player’s WPM while also incorporating the Box2D physics engine for the castle. We also thought of implementing a “Math Mode” where, instead of words flying across the screen, there are math equations that you must solve.
